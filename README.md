## About the project

This project is a technical task for a Frontend Developer position. Technologies used: React.js and Tailwind CSS. I decided to use Tailwind CSS as it allows you to style your web app quickly, without writing any CSS on your own. If I had more time, I would rather use Styled Components and spend more time creating an app's custom styles.

I have made a research on Redux-Form, I even installed it on my project but ultimately haven't used it because of the time limitations. Decided to create a form in a safe way without using technology I haven't used before, but would definitely used if I had extra time.

I dedicated 1-2 hours a day for this project, from June 1st to June 6th. Overall it took me around 8-10 hours to complete it. If I spent more time I would definitely improve it. I think I would desplay the validation message from API on the website, instead of validate the form before sending it to the API. I just realised about the API validation after I created my own form validation.
